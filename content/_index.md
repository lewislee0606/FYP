With the recent emphasis on RegTech by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the rapid development of the Web3 and Virtual Assets industries, this project's primary objective is to enable the traditional financial market to effectively leverage RegTech solutions to combat potential financial fraud and commercial crime. Additionally, it aims to provide the public with a reliable credit scoring system to evaluate potential virtual asset platforms for investment purposes. To understand the project's direction, it is essential to examine the limitations in both the traditional financial market and the emerging virtual assets market.


We will update the project progress through this website, e.g., [posts](/post/), [case studies](/case/), or [prototypes](/code/).
